      "reasoning": "The current market price of 4.9% implies a high probability that Donald Trump will win the 2024 election (and thus be term-limited), or that he will not run if he loses. However, prediction markets currently show a volatile race for 2024. If Trump loses 2024, his probability of securing the 2028 nomination is historically very high for a former incumbent seeking a rematch (similar to Grover Cleveland). My estimated probability assumes a ~35-40% chance of a 2024 loss multiplied by a high conditional probability of running and winning the nomination in 2028. The edge exceeds the 10% threshold.",

        "If Donald Trump loses in 2024, historical precedent and current polling suggest he would be the overwhelming frontrunner for the 2028 nomination should he choose to run."
