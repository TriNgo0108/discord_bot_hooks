      "reasoning": "The market odds of 5.5% present a massive mispricing compared to the data in the search results. While there is negative news regarding private doubts from officials, he is still explicitly labeled as the 'frontrunner' and holds a 50% probability on a major competitor platform (Kalshi). The 5.5% price suggests the market has overreacted to the bearish news or suffers from low liquidity. The probability of a sitting frontrunner and NEC Director being nominated is significantly higher than 5.5%.",
      "risk_factors": [
        "The reported private doubts from Trump officials could lead to Hassett withdrawing or being disqualified from the race.",
        "Trump's decision-making is unpredictable; he may choose a wildcard candidate not currently in the media spotlight.",
        "The significant price discrepancy (5.5% vs 50%) might indicate a specific rule or condition in this market that lowers the probability, though not evident in the provided text."

        "Kevin Hassett is currently the Director of the U.S. National Economic Council and is widely considered the 'frontrunner' for the Fed Chair position.",
        "Competing prediction market platform Kalshi estimates Hassett's probability at 50%, despite noting a recent 20-point drop.",
        "Trump officials have privately raised doubts about Hassett's suitability, questioning if his communication skills align with the desire for 'real change' at the Fed and criticizing his role in the trade regime rollout."

While there is counter-risk regarding Hassett's relationship with Trump, the true probability based on recent high-volume trading activity and momentum is clearly higher than the current offering. The edge of 11.5% meets the threshold for action.",

      "confidence": 7,
      "reasoning": "The analysis indicates a significant price discrepancy between the current market (8.6%) and a closely related liquid market on Kalshi which recently traded at 18%. Given that Waller is a current Fed Governor—unlike external candidates like Warsh or Hassett—he has a structural advantage in terms of experience and existing Senate relationships. The true probability is likely closer to the 18-20% range, as confirmed by the trading volume and sentiment on Kalshi. The current 8.6% price appears to undervalue his standing. With an estimated probability of 20% versus a market price of 8.6%, there is an 11.4% edge, which meets the 10% threshold for action.",
      "risk_factors": [
        "The discrepancy between 8.6% and 18% may be due to specific negative news regarding Waller that is not captured in these search results.",
        "Trump's decision-making is highly volatile; he may favor a more political outsider like Kevin Hassett over a sitting governor.",
        "The long time horizon (until end of 2026) introduces uncertainty regarding changing economic conditions that might favor a different candidate profile (e.g., a hawk vs. dove)."
