      "market_question": "Will Trump nominate Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair?",

      "estimated_probability": 0.5,
      "edge_percentage": 19.5,
      "recommendation": "LONG",
      "confidence": 8,
      "reasoning": "The market odds of 30.5% appear significantly undervalued relative to the President's explicit public endorsement placing Warsh 'at the top of the list.' When a sitting President narrows the field to two 'leading contenders' and calls one the top of that list, the probability should arguably be above 50%, barring unforeseen scandals or withdrawal. The current price implies skepticism that Trump will follow through, but the direct verbal commitment provides strong alpha.",
      "risk_factors": [
        "Trump is known for changing his mind frequently.",
        "Senate confirmation concerns regarding Warsh's past tenure or views could influence the final decision.",
        "The possibility of an unexpected dark horse candidate emerging."

        "President Trump explicitly identified Kevin Warsh as being 'at the top of the list' for Fed Chair.",
        "Trump referred to Warsh and Hassett as the 'two Kevins' and stated they are the leading contenders.",
        "The comments were made in a December 2025 interview with the Wall Street Journal."

      "edge_percentage": 18.5,
      "recommendation": "LONG",
      "confidence": 7,
      "reasoning": "At 6.5%, the market is severely underpricing Hassett's chances given he was named by Trump as a 'leading contender' alongside Warsh. In a binary or near-binary race defined by the President, the second-place named contender should have significantly higher odds than 6.5%. If the race is truly between the 'two Kevins' as Trump stated, Hassett serves as a strong hedge or primary value play if Warsh stumbles.",
      "risk_factors": [
        "He appears to be the 'runner-up' in Trump's eyes based on the 'top of the list' comment for Warsh.",
        "His proximity to the administration might be viewed as a negative for Fed independence.",
        "Market may be pricing in a potential different pick outside the two mentioned."

      "key_findings": [
        "Trump named Hassett as one of two 'leading contenders' for the role.",
        "Hassett currently serves as the National Economic Council Director.",
        "Trump referred to Hassett and Warsh as the 'two Kevins' and called them both 'great'."
