      "edge_percentage": 14.5,
      "recommendation": "SHORT",
      "confidence": 7,
      "reasoning": "The market is pricing the Thunder as a near-dynasty with a ~40% chance to win the title in 2026. While the Thunder have arguably the best young core and asset sheet in the league, assigning a nearly 1 in 2 chance to a single team two years in the future is aggressive, especially given the volatility of player development and injury in the NBA. A 25% probability is a very strong bullish stance, but the market is over-leveraged.",
      "risk_factors": [
        "No current injury news or off-season updates available.",
        "Unknown Western Conference power shifts (e.g., Nuggets, Mavericks, Warriors re-tooling).",

        "The team is young and ascending, but the 39.5% implied probability is historically very high for a futures market two years out."

      "confidence": 8,
      "reasoning": "At 1.7%, the market is significantly undervaluing a sitting Governor of a swing state who has already been vetted for national office. In an open primary (assuming Biden does not run or is not the incumbent), Governors are typically strong frontrunners. Her odds should likely be closer to 10-15% given her bona fides.",
      "risk_factors": [
        "The Democratic party may pivot to a more progressive candidate, leaving Whitmer too moderate.",
        "High-profile competition from figures like Kamala Harris or Gavin Newsom may split the moderate vote."

        "She was a finalist for the Vice Presidential nomination in 2024 and 2020, indicating high regard within the party elite.",
        "She has re-election experience and a track record of governing, fitting the standard profile for Democratic nominees."

      "reasoning": "The Ravens are legitimate championship contenders with an MVP quarterback and a solid roster construction.
