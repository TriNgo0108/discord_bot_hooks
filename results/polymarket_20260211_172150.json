      "reasoning": "The market is pricing in an extremely high degree of stability (90.5%) for an event over a year away. While the Fed may be in a holding pattern by March 2026, the probability of a 'Hike' or a 'Cut' seems underestimated. If inflation proves stickier than expected, a hike is possible. If the economy slows, a cut is possible. The 'No Change' option loses in *both* scenarios. With the current pricing, the market is effectively ignoring the 'fat tails' of macroeconomic shocks 18 months out. A fair probability for 'No Change' is likely closer to 75-80%, accounting for a higher chance of a rate hike or unexpected cut than the 9.5% currently implied.",
      "risk_factors": [
        "The Fed successfully engineers a soft landing and rates remain exactly static for an extended period.",
        "Inflation data aligns perfectly with 2% targets, removing any need for adjustment.",
        "Market liquidity is low, making the 90.5% price indicative of a wide spread rather than true probability."

      "key_findings": [
        "No specific search results were provided for this query.",
        "Market prices imply a ~90.5% chance of status quo and ~9.5% chance of any movement (cuts or hikes) by March 2026.",
        "Historical Fed funds futures data suggests that while volatility flattens over time, assigning a >90% probability to 'No Change' 18+ months out is statistically aggressive given macro uncertainty (election cycles, inflation stickiness).",
        "The market structure implicitly assigns a very low probability (~1-2%) to a rate hike, which may underestimate structural inflation risks or fiscal dominance scenarios."
