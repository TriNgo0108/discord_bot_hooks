      "reasoning": "The market odds of 0.1% are extremely low for a club with Newcastle's financial backing and potential. Even in a worst-case scenario, Newcastle is a top-6 contender. A true probability of ~1.5% (approx 66/1) is more realistic for a wealthy club aiming for Champions League spots. This represents a massive relative edge (Estimated is 15x higher than Market). Without search results to contradict this structural advantage, the LONG position is statistically favorable.",

      "recommendation": "SHORT",
      "confidence": 7,
      "reasoning": "The market price of 25% implies a roughly 1-in-4 chance of a significant escalation (US strike on Iranian soil) by Feb 2026. This appears significantly overvalued compared to the Jan 31 market (11%). A 14% probability jump occurring solely within a 5-day window in early Feb 2026 suggests a pricing error or low liquidity rather than a genuine geopolitical event horizon. Based on historical US-Iran relations, the baseline probability of a direct US strike on the homeland is typically low (<10%). The market is likely mispricing the risk.",
      "risk_factors": [
        "Unknown specific intelligence regarding early February 2026 deadlines (e.g., nuclear talks, sanctions snapback).",
        "Sudden escalation in the Middle East (e.g., involving Israel) that forces US involvement."

      "key_findings": [
        "No specific search results were provided to explain the sharp probability divergence between the Jan 31 and Feb 5 markets.",
        "Historical precedent suggests the US avoids direct strikes on Iranian soil due to escalation risks.",
        "Market structure shows a +14% probability jump in just 5 days (Jan 31 vs Feb 5), which is statistically anomalous without a specific known catalyst (e.g., a scheduled diplomatic deadline or expiration)."
